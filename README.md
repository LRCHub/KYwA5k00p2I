[00:20.73] I see the crystal raindrops fall
[00:23.40] And the beauty of it all
[00:25.82] Is when the sun comes shining through
[00:30.63] To make those rainbows in my mind
[00:33.44] When I think of you sometimes
[00:35.84] And I wanna spend some time with you
[00:53.84] 
[00:39.31] Just the two of us
[00:42.26] We can make it if we try
[00:44.68] Just the two of us
[00:47.46] (Just the two of us)
[00:57.46] 
[00:49.39] Just the two of us
[00:52.27] Building castles in the sky
[00:54.65] Just the two of us
[00:57.28] You and I
[01:01.78] 
[01:00.64] We look for love, no time for tears
[01:03.52] Wasted waters all that is
[01:05.82] And it don't make no flowers grow
[01:10.68] Good things might come to those who wait
[01:13.47] Not for those who wait too late
[01:16.04] We got to go for all we know
[01:30.04] 
[01:19.46] Just the two of us
[01:22.25] We can make it if we try
[01:24.64] Just the two of us
[01:27.50] (Just the two of us)
[01:37.50] 
[01:29.36] Just the two of us
[01:31.91] Building new castles in the sky
[01:34.67] Just the two of us
[01:37.23] You and I
[01:41.73] 
[02:12.18] I hear the crystal raindrops fall
[02:14.91] On the window down the hall
[02:17.34] And it becomes the morning dew
[02:22.13] And, darling, when the morning comes
[02:24.91] And I see the morning sun
[02:27.56] I wanna be the one with you
[02:41.06] 
[02:30.96] Just the two of us
[02:33.75] We can make it if we try
[02:36.32] Just the two of us
[02:38.88] (Just the two of us)
[02:48.88] 
[02:40.93] Just the two of us
[02:43.49] Building big castles way on high
[02:46.23] Just the two of us
[02:48.82] You and I
[02:53.32] 
[02:51.77] (Just the two of us) yeah, just the two of us
[02:53.99] (We can make it, just the two of us)
[02:57.80] Better get it together, baby, yeah
[03:01.21] (Just the two of us) yeah, just the two of us
[03:05.22] (We can make it, just the two of us)
[03:23.22] 
[03:08.92] (Just the two of us)
[03:15.50] (We can make it, just the two of us)
[03:21.49] (Just the two of us)
[03:25.56] (We can make it, just the two of us)
[03:43.56]
